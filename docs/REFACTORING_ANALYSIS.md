# Refactoring Analysis

The Visualization Kernel has undergone a comprehensive refactoring process, transforming it from the original HyperAV visualizer into a more robust, flexible, and extensible system. This effort was aimed at enabling detailed data-driven control and preparing the kernel for integration with advanced AI systems like the Parserator Micro-Kernel (PMK).

## Key Refactoring Achievements and Core Architectural Changes

The refactoring initiative has resulted in significant enhancements to the kernel's capabilities and architecture. The following are the primary achievements, extracted from the detailed breakdown in `ANALYSIS_AND_RECOMMENDATIONS.md`:

1.  **WebGL2 Upgrade:** The core rendering engine was upgraded to utilize a WebGL2 context, unlocking access to modern WebGL features and improving performance and capabilities.

2.  **Uniform Buffer Object (UBO) Implementation:** A UBO named `GlobalDataBlock` was implemented, providing a `pmk_channels[64]` array. This allows for scalable and efficient input of up to 64 global data channels to all shaders, a significant improvement over the previous 8-channel uniform.

3.  **Comprehensive System-Wide Parameterization:** A vast array of visual parameters across all geometries (`Hypercube`, `Hypersphere`, `Hypertetrahedron`, `Duocylinder`), projection methods (`Perspective`, `Stereographic`, `Orthographic`), and the `FullScreenLattice` effect were exposed. This includes detailed control over rotations, morphing, colors, line/shell thicknesses, grid densities, and effect-specific attributes.

4.  **`HypercubeCore.js` Enhancement:** This central class was significantly enhanced to manage the state for the greatly expanded set of visual parameters and to handle the UBO updates efficiently.

5.  **Integration and Modularization of `FullScreenLatticeEffect`:** The previously standalone full-screen lattice visualization was refactored into `core/FullScreenLatticeGeometry.js` and integrated as a selectable geometry type (`fullscreenlattice`) within the main kernel, its parameters now controllable via the central API.

6.  **Enhanced `VisualizerController.js` as Primary API:** `VisualizerController.js` was established as the primary interface for all external control. Its `updateData(dataSnapshot: object)` method was made more robust to accept complex and arbitrarily structured JavaScript objects.

7.  **Parameter Mapping Layer:** A foundational Parameter Mapping Layer was implemented within `VisualizerController.js`. This layer is responsible for translating fields from the input `dataSnapshot` to specific indices within the `pmk_channels` UBO and/or directly to controllable state parameters in `HypercubeCore.js`. It supports initial configuration and dynamic updates to mapping rules.

These changes have collectively created a more powerful and adaptable visualization system, ready for sophisticated data-driven control and integration.
