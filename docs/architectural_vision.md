# Architectural Vision for Visualization Kernel and PMK

This document outlines the refined architectural vision for the Visualization Kernel, Parserator Micro-Kernel (PMK), and associated systems, based on discussions on [Date of discussion - placeholder].

## Core Architectural Principles: Distributed Intelligence

The system is envisioned as a distributed intelligence architecture with two primary tiers:

1.  **Localized AI/Edge Component (Kerbalized Parserator):**
    *   **Nature:** A compact, high-speed AI module designed to run on edge devices or in close proximity to a multitude of sensors and entities (potentially hundreds).
    *   **Primary Functions:**
        *   **Efficient Parsing:** Its core task is to parse incoming data streams from sensors using the `KerbelizedParserator` engine.
        *   **Sensor Interaction & Local Tuning:** Directly interacts with sensors. This includes adjusting sensor parameters or focus based on directives from the Cloud AI.
        *   **Adaptive Schema Management:** Utilizes an `AdaptiveSchemaGraph` for its parsing logic. This graph is adapted locally based on parsing performance and directives from the Cloud AI.
    *   **Characteristics:** Optimized for low latency and real-time processing.

2.  **Cloud AI Orchestrator:**
    *   **Nature:** A more powerful, higher-level AI system residing in the cloud, connected to the localized AI components via a high-bandwidth, low-latency network (e.g., 6G).
    *   **Primary Functions:**
        *   **Strategic Direction:** Provides overall strategic goals and direction to the distributed fleet of localized AIs.
        *   **Focus & Sensor Tuning Commands:** Instructs local AIs on what data to prioritize or how to configure their attached sensors (e.g., "for sensor X, focus on parameter Y under conditions Z").
        *   **Schema Adaptation Guidance:** Sends directives that influence how the local `AdaptiveSchemaGraph` should evolve or which parsing strategies to employ.
        *   **Global Error Correction & Optimization:** Monitors overall system performance and provides corrective feedback or updated models to the local AIs.
        *   **Data Topology Analysis (Implied):** Likely analyzes aggregated data or patterns from local AIs to make strategic decisions.

## Key Components and Their Roles (Refined Understanding):

*   **`KerbelizedParserator.js`:** The engine for the Localized AI. Contains the parsing logic and interacts with its internal components.
*   **`AdaptiveSchemaGraph.js`:** Resides within each `KerbelizedParserator`. It's the dynamic knowledge structure used for parsing. Its adaptation is driven by local parsing results *and* by directives/tuning parameters from the Cloud AI.
*   **`BayesianFocusOptimizer.js`:** Likely part of the `KerbelizedParserator`. It helps the local AI tune its focus, but its optimization strategy or target parameters can be influenced or set by the Cloud AI.
*   **`PMKDataAdapter.js`:** Facilitates the translation of data from the `KerbelizedParserator`'s output into a format suitable for the `VisualizerController`. It might also play a role in formatting data to be sent to the Cloud AI.
*   **`VisualizerController.js` (and `HypercubeCore.js`):** Provides the visualization capabilities. This could be used locally (e.g., for an edge device's diagnostic interface) or to send visual summaries/snapshots to the Cloud AI or a central monitoring dashboard.
*   **`HOASBridge.js` (Higher Order Abstraction System Bridge):** This component is crucial for the communication between the Cloud AI Orchestrator and the Localized AI(s). It would:
    *   Translate high-level strategic commands from the Cloud AI into specific configurations, parameters, or operational directives for `KerbelizedParserator` and its sub-components.
    *   Relay status, summaries, or salient data from the Local AI(s) back to the Cloud AI.
*   **`PPPProjector.js` & `TimestampedThoughtBuffer.js`:** These components remain important for advanced parsing capabilities within the `KerbelizedParserator`, helping with tasks like resolving ambiguity or maintaining context. Their operation could also be influenced by Cloud AI directives (e.g., adjusting buffer sizes, projection strategies).

## Adaptive Schema Intelligence (ASI) - Clarified

ASI is achieved through the interplay of:
1.  The local `KerbelizedParserator` adapting its `AdaptiveSchemaGraph` based on its direct parsing experiences.
2.  The Cloud AI Orchestrator providing higher-level guidance, tuning parameters, and strategic objectives that shape the local adaptation process and sensor interaction.

The Local AI does not expose its raw `AdaptiveSchemaGraph` for arbitrary external systems to directly parse and control themselves. Instead, control and major tuning are mediated by the Cloud AI, which then directs the Local AI.

## Implications for Development:

*   The interface and communication protocol between the Cloud AI and the Local AI (likely via `HOASBridge`) becomes a critical design point.
*   `KerbelizedParserator` and its components need to be configurable and controllable by these external directives.
*   The `AdaptiveSchemaGraph` needs mechanisms to incorporate guidance from the Cloud AI into its adaptation logic.
*   Visualization may serve multiple purposes: local diagnostics, data summaries for the Cloud AI, and potentially real-time topological displays for human oversight.

This refined vision emphasizes a hierarchical control system, leveraging fast local parsing with strategic cloud-based oversight and optimization.
