# Systems Manifest: Visualization Kernel & Adaptive Parsing Engine

## 1. Purpose of This Manifest

This Systems Manifest serves as a comprehensive guide to the architecture, components, design rationale, and operational dynamics of the Visualization Kernel and its integrated Adaptive Parsing Engine (primarily embodied by the `KerbelizedParserator`). It is intended for:

*   **Current and Future Developers:** To understand the system's structure, how components interact, and the design decisions behind them.
*   **Architects:** To have a clear reference for ongoing design and evolution.
*   **Integrators:** To understand how to interface with and control the system (e.g., via `HOASBridge`).

This manifest aims to be a "living document" that evolves with the project. It complements more formal API documentation by providing narrative explanations, design context, and a guide to the "why" and "how" of the system.

## 2. Project Vision

The overarching goal is to create an advanced, headless visualization kernel (`HyperAV` concept, evolving into `VisualizationKernel`) coupled with a highly adaptive parsing engine (`Parserator Micro-Kernel` or PMK, evolving into `KerbelizedParserator`). This system is designed for:

*   **N-Dimensional Data Visualization:** Representing complex data topologies geometrically.
*   **Agentic Systems Interface:** Providing visual feedback and data display for AI agents.
*   **Adaptive Parsing:** Intelligently parsing and structuring data, capable of learning and evolving its parsing strategies.
*   **Robotics & Sensor Fusion:** Eventually integrating with robotics platforms to process and visualize sensor data in real-time, guided by higher-level AI.

## 3. Core Architectural Model: Distributed Intelligence

The system architecture is based on a distributed intelligence model, primarily involving:

*   **Localized AI/Edge Component (`KerbelizedParserator`):**
    *   A fast, compact AI module running close to data sources (e.g., sensors).
    *   Responsible for real-time parsing, local schema adaptation, and direct sensor interaction based on high-level directives.
    *   Utilizes `AdaptiveSchemaGraph` for dynamic schema management and `BayesianFocusOptimizer` to tune its parsing parameters.

*   **Cloud AI Orchestrator (Conceptual):**
    *   A higher-level strategic AI (likely an LLM-based system) residing in the cloud.
    *   Connects to local AI components via a high-bandwidth, low-latency network (e.g., 6G).
    *   Provides strategic direction, tunes the focus of local AIs, guides schema adaptation strategies, and manages global error correction and optimization.

*   **`HOASBridge` (Higher Order Abstraction System Bridge):**
    *   The crucial intermediary facilitating communication between the Cloud AI Orchestrator and the `KerbelizedParserator` instance(s).
    *   Translates strategic goals from the Cloud AI into operational configurations for the local parsing engine.

*   **`VisualizerController` & `HypercubeCore`:**
    *   The visualization front-end, responsible for rendering data. It receives processed data snapshots from `PMKDataAdapter`.

*   **`PMKDataAdapter`:**
    *   Translates the output of `KerbelizedParserator` into a format suitable for `VisualizerController`, and triggers geometry/style changes.
