# Systems Manifest: Development Roadmap and Vision

## 1. Overarching Vision

The core vision for this project is the creation of an advanced, interconnected system comprising:

*   A **highly adaptive, intelligent parsing engine** (evolving from PMK concepts into `KerbelizedParserator`) capable of understanding and structuring complex data, potentially from diverse and numerous sources like visual sensors in robotics.
*   A **headless, API-driven N-dimensional visualization kernel** (evolving from `HyperAV` concepts into `VisualizationKernel` with `VisualizerController` and `HypercubeCore`) for representing data topologies and system states.
*   An **orchestration layer** (conceptualized as a Cloud AI communicating via `HOASBridge`) that can direct and tune the local parsing and visualization components.

This system aims to be a powerful tool for agentic AI, advanced data analysis, and real-time sensor data processing in fields like 6G robotics.

For more detailed articulations of the vision, please refer to:
*   [`systems_manifest/00_Overview_and_Architecture.md`](./00_Overview_and_Architecture.md)
*   The original architectural concepts detailed in `docs/architectural_vision.md`.

## 2. Current State of Development (as of this Manifest's last update)

*   **Core Parsing Engine (`KerbelizedParserator` and sub-components):**
    *   Foundational implementations are in place.
    *   Components are highly configurable via a detailed API.
    *   Initial adaptive logic has been implemented:
        *   `AdaptiveSchemaGraph` can adjust schema strengths and dynamically generate new (placeholder) schemas based on performance and context hints.
        *   `BayesianFocusOptimizer` can adjust focus parameters (temperature, abstraction weight) based on history, configured goals, and an exploration factor.
    *   A feedback loop exists where `KerbelizedParserator` informs the optimizer about performance.
*   **Control Interface (`HOASBridge`):**
    *   A basic `HOASBridge` is implemented, capable of receiving commands and reconfiguring `KerbelizedParserator`.
*   **Visualization Pipeline (Conceptual Data Flow):**
    *   `PMKDataAdapter` translates `KerbelizedParserator` output into a generic snapshot.
    *   `VisualizerController` receives this snapshot and uses its internal mapping rules to conceptually prepare data for `HypercubeCore`.
    *   `HypercubeCore` has logging in place to show that data parameters (like data channels, glitch intensity) are received at the core level.
    *   The actual WebGPU rendering logic in `HypercubeCore` to fully utilize all these parameters is still under development and refinement.
*   **Testing:**
    *   Unit tests exist for most PMK components, `HOASBridge`, `VisualizerController`, and `PMKDataAdapter`.
    *   An integration test (`examples/test-pmk-integration.js`) demonstrates the flow from `HOASBridge` through `KerbelizedParserator`'s adaptive logic and `PMKDataAdapter` to a dummy `VisualizerController`.

## 3. Summarized Development Roadmap

The following is a summary of key development phases. For more granular details, please refer to the original `docs/development-roadmap.md` or the content within the `.claude/development-roadmap.md` file.

*   **Phase 1: Core Stabilization (Largely complete for JS components; ongoing for WebGPU in HypercubeCore)**
    *   Initial JavaScript component structure and functionality.
    *   WebGL2 migration (shifted to WebGPU for `HypercubeCore`).
    *   Comprehensive parameterization and mapping layers.

*   **Phase 2: PMK Integration (Significant progress made)**
    *   Implementation of `KerbelizedParserator`, `PPPProjector`, `AdaptiveSchemaGraph`.
    *   Initial adaptive logic (schema strength, basic schema generation).
    *   Circular reasoning visualization modes (conceptual stage).

*   **Phase 3: HOAS Implementation (Foundational progress made)**
    *   Design and implementation of `HOASBridge`.
    *   Implementation of `BayesianFocusOptimizer` (initial adaptive logic).
    *   Creation of `TimestampedThoughtBuffer`.
    *   Focus variable tuning system (partially addressed via optimizer).

*   **Phase 4: Advanced Visualization & Core Features (Next major focus areas)**
    *   **Full WebGPU Rendering in `HypercubeCore`:** Complete the transition and enable dynamic visual responses to all data parameters.
    *   **Visualization of Adaptive States:** Design and implement how schema changes, focus parameter evolution, and PPP projections are visually represented.
    *   **Dynamic Shader Snippet Injection / Uber-shader System:** For highly flexible and data-driven visuals.
    *   **Headless Operation & Output:** FBO rendering, video sequence generation.

*   **Phase 5: Deepening AI & 6G Robotics Integration (Longer-term)**
    *   **Sophisticated Adaptive Logic:** More advanced Bayesian methods, complex schema evolution strategies, robust circular reasoning resolution.
    *   **Cloud AI - HOASBridge - PMK Communication:** Define and implement the full communication protocol and richer interactions.
    *   **Robotics-Specific Features:** Edge device communication, local LLM swarm visualization, sensor fusion display modes, real-time collaborative visualization.

## 4. Guiding Principles for Development

*   **Iterative Progress:** Build foundational components first, then iteratively add intelligence and complexity.
*   **Modularity:** Keep components well-defined and loosely coupled where possible.
*   **Configurability:** Allow external systems to control and tune behavior.
*   **Testability:** Develop unit and integration tests alongside features.
*   **Documentation:** Maintain clear documentation of architecture, APIs, and components (like this manifest).
*   **Experimental Approach:** Be open to refining the architecture and component designs as the system evolves and new insights are gained.

This roadmap and vision will continue to be refined as the project progresses.
